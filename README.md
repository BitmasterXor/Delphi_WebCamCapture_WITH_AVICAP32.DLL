Example Code
Hereâ€™s a brief look at how the video capture is started and stopped:
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
  DeviceIndex: Integer;
begin
  DeviceIndex := ComboBox1.ItemIndex;
  if DeviceIndex = -1 then
  begin
    MessageDlg('Please select a webcam device from the list.', mtWarning, [mbOK], 0);
    Exit;
  end;

  if Self.Button1.Caption = 'Start Webcam Capture!' then
  begin
    Self.Button1.Caption := 'Stop Webcam Capture!';
    CaptureWnd := capCreateCaptureWindowA('CaptureWindow', WS_CHILD or WS_VISIBLE, Image1.Left, Image1.Top, Image1.Width, Image1.Height, Handle, 0);
    if CaptureWnd <> 0 then
    begin
      SendMessage(CaptureWnd, WM_CAP_DRIVER_CONNECT, DeviceIndex, 0);
      SendMessage(CaptureWnd, WM_CAP_SET_PREVIEWRATE, 40, 0);
      SendMessage(CaptureWnd, WM_CAP_SET_PREVIEW, 1, 0);
    end
    else
      MessageDlg('Error creating capture window', mtError, [mbOK], 0);
  end
  else
  begin
    if CaptureWnd <> 0 then
    begin
      SendMessage(CaptureWnd, WM_CAP_DRIVER_DISCONNECT, 0, 0);
      CaptureWnd := 0;
    end;
    Self.Button1.Caption := 'Start Webcam Capture!';
  end;
end;
